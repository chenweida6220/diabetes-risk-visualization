# Project Name
This project is a part of the Data Visualization Project at [COOP Careers Fellowship](https://coopcareers.org/).

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify and visualize risk factors associated with diabetes in the U.S. adult population using health survey data. By uncovering patterns in behavioral and demographic characteristics, the project aims to raise awareness about the prevalence of diabetes and its correlation with variables such as BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and education. The ultimate goal is to support public health initiatives by presenting data-driven insights that inform prevention, early detection, and resource allocation strategies. This project contributes to civic efforts by translating raw public health data into accessible visuals that can guide both individual behavior and community health policy.

### Methods Used
* Data Cleaning & Processing
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Tableau

## Project Description
This project uses data from the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset?resource=download&select=diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv), which includes responses from over 441,000 adults and 330 features representing health behaviors, conditions, and demographic attributes.

The key research questions explored include:
1. What demographic and lifestyle factors are most associated with diabetes risk?
2. How do diabetes, pre-diabetes, and non-diabetic populations differ in terms of BMI, blood pressure, and cholesterol?
3. Does education level play a protective role in diabetes prevalence?
